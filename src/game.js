/*TO DO:
All major features have been added.

Possible additions:
*Add limits to how close an object can spawn to the player. I've already made it so they can't spawn on the same place,
but having them not spawn directly next to each other would work too.
*Add CSS to the HTML pages. It's not needed, but it would make the pages look better.
*Color-code some of the text: red for enemies, green and blue for the health item and door.
*CHECK: Do enemies move before or after the room is drawn? They should spawn in as it's drawn, but only move after the player first moves.

Backend improvements:
*BUG: Text changes sizes slightly when moving. Is there a way to do it with percents instead of always being a set pixel size?
*CLEANUP: An easier way to check what's directly next to a space on the grid. getGridPosition is only for the player, it should be able to go from any position.
*CLEANUP: Reorganize functions and variables so they're in a more logical order.
