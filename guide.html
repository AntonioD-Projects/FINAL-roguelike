        <h1>Guide</h1>
        <p>This is a tutorial for how to play my game.</p>

        <p>Each object in the game is represented by an ASCII character.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>P</b>: Your player. You can move with the arrow keys.</li>
            <li><b>--</b>: A wall. Nothing can move past these.</li>
            <li><b>E</b>: An enemy. It moves around at random. If you move into it, or it moves into you, you lose a point of health. The bigger the room is, the more enemies that can spawn.</li>
            <li><b>H</b>: A health bonus. Collect it to restore one point of health.</li>
            <li><b>D</b>: A door. If you walk into it, you go to a new room.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your health meter is shown at the bottom left. Each red "H" represents a point of health. The maximum health cap is 7. If you lose all your health, the game ends.</p>

        <p>A score counter is shown at the bottom right. Your score goes up by 1 every time you enter a door, and is reset when the game ends.</p>
